# Math Computer Vision Projects

A collection of mathematical approaches to computer vision problems

## Projects

### 1. SVD Image Denoising
Implementation of Singular Value Decomposition for image noise reduction. This project demonstrates how matrix factorization can be used to separate signal from noise in digital images.

**Key Concepts:**
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Low-rank approximation
- Image processing fundamentals

## Getting Started

Each project contains its own directory with implementation code, examples, and documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.12
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Current Projects

- `image_denoising.ipynb` - SVD-based image denoising implementation

More projects coming soon!
